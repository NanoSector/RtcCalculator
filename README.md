# RTC Conflict Calculator
Built as an addendum to [the excellent Dortania guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/misc/rtc.html), this calculator helps you to find bad RTC regions.

**Please note that this tool is only designed to help you bisect RTC conflict addresses. It does not provide any guarantee that you will get a valid result or that the provided result is accurate.**

**Always refer to the [RTCMemoryFixup](https://github.com/acidanthera/RTCMemoryFixup) documentation for the latest guidelines.**

**Always keep in mind that your issue MIGHT NOT be RTC related.**

- Windows: Extract and double click `RtcCalculator.exe`
- macOS: Extract and double click `RtcCalculator`
